## 📌 Abstract

With the growing reliance on digital platforms, entrepreneurs face rising cybersecurity risks while simultaneously encountering new business opportunities. This paper investigates both — the **challenges such as regulatory constraints, resource limitations, and lack of awareness**, and **opportunities like AI-powered security services, blockchain-based identity systems, and cybersecurity venture funding**. The work proposes a scalable, AI-integrated Security-as-a-Service (SecaaS) model tailored for SMEs.
